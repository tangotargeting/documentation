A campaign is a process of presenting messages to users and collecting their "responses". Each campaign is composed of **a message**, **a set of actions**, **a set of rules** for presenting the message **and useful insights** based on the aggregated user actions data.

### The message


<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8">
Here's an example of a message.
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
